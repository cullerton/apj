        <p>When my friend Leanne moved into the neighborhood, she brought a wonderful tradition of gathering once a month for community dinner. Leanne usually cooked the main course, and everyone else brought what they could.</p>

        <p>Sometimes it was a packed house, with three generations of friends and family eating together. Other times, there were more dogs than humans. But it was always a great time to gather with friends, eat good food, and relax--even when the dogs were barking and the kids were crying.</p>

        <p>This is my spin on her practice, while she is away.</p>

        <p>Please bring your favorite pizza topping, or something else to share. We will provide all the fixings for a delicious homemade cheese pizza. The rest is up to you. That means the toppings you bring determine the pizzas we eat. So make sure it's something I like!</p>

        <p>This is a family friendly event. Children passing the dog test<sup>(1)</sup> are welcome.</p>

        <p>The point is to spend time with each other.</p>

        <p><sup>(1) </sup>Children must pass the dog test. This means they must be as well-behaved as the dogs. This may sound like an easy test. It is not.</p>
